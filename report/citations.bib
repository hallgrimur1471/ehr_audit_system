	abstract = {Contrary to widespread assumption, dynamic RAM (DRAM), the main memory in most modern
	computers, retains its contents for several seconds after power is lost, even at room
	temperature and even if removed from a motherboard. Although DRAM becomes less reliable
	when it is not refreshed, it is not immediately erased, and its contents persist sufficiently
	for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show
	that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic
	key material from an attacker with physical access to a machine. It poses a particular
	threat to laptop users who rely on disk encryption: we demonstrate that it could be
	used to compromise several popular disk encryption products without the need for any
	special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability
	of memory retention and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically
	with simple cooling techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic
	keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss
	several strategies for mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would
	eliminate them.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the Internet of Things. Main enabling factor of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details.}
