Specs:
* Five patients, two audit companies who attempt to access the audit data.
* Guarding EHR data not required.
* Audit data is given in clear as input to the system.
* Should be scalable and distributed but for PoC simplicity it can run on single machine and socket programming is not needed, message exchange can be implemented by writing and reading to and from a file.
* Confidentiality & integrity protection required of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
* The system should enforce immutability, if an attacker tampers with some audit data the system should report the attack. Just detection of tempering is enough.
* Implement routines to support identification and authorization
* Implement routines to support "Decentralization" goal

Queries:
* Patients can query the system to monitor usage of their EHR data.
    * Add get_query_history route?
* Audit companies can query the system to monitor usage of EHR data for a set of patients.

Audit record:
* Date and time of logged event
* Patient ID whose record was accessed
* User ID who performed the logged event
* Action type (create, delete, change, query, print, copy)

Architecture ideas:
* EHR Rest API sends record to Audit Rest API, Audit Rest API encrypts data using patients public key and the audit companies public key and stores in the audit log.
* When patient requests query data he needs to authenticate somehow (sign a timestamp? maybe sign instead a nonce sent by the Audit Rest API? Or server encrypts a random number with patient's public key and the patient needs to decrypt it and send it back?) Data is sent to the patient encrypted and symmetric key is sent encrypted as well using patient's key, just like it's stored.

Authentication ideas:
* server encrypts a random number with patient's public key and the patient needs to decrypt it and send it back
    * Insecure against MitM attack (Lecture 7, slide 59) but only if public key is sent by patient (we need CA or hard-coded pubkeys on server end).
    * Problem: nothing binds this exchange to subsequent communications.
* server & patient establish a shared secret and patient sends some MAC message (timestamp?)
* Authenticate every message PGP style

Signing:
* Use RSA-FDH (Lecture 9, slide 52)
* Use ECDSA (NIST standard): https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/signature/dsa.html?highlight=ECDSA
* RFC 8017 requires RSASSA-PSS over RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 in new applications
* "ECDSA is probabilistic in a bad way, where random generation is vital to the security of the signature.": https://www.scottbrady91.com/jose/jwts-which-signing-algorithm-should-i-use
    * So let's use RSA-PSS instead, and use different keys for signing than for encryption.

CA:
* CA must verify Alice's identity out of band, simplify by assuming unique usernames?
* About certificate information (lecture 10, slide 27)
* Standard: X.509 (lecture 10, slide 32)

Messages from patient -> audit server:
* Use PGP style authentication, integrity & encryption scheme
    * Signing algorithm: ECDSA
    * Encryption algorithm: AES GCM mode

Authenticated encryption:
* Use GCM:
"""
import json
from base64 import b64encode
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

header = b"header"
data = b"secret"
key = get_random_bytes(32)
key = get_random_bytes(16)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)
cipher.update(header)
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data)
json_k = ["nonce", "header", "ciphertext", "tag"]
nonce = cipher.nonce
print(len(nonce.hex()))
json_v = [
    b64encode(x).decode("utf-8") for x in [nonce, header, ciphertext, tag]
]
result = json.dumps(dict(zip(json_k, json_v)), indent=2)
print(result)
"""

Questions:
* Should audit companies only be allowed to query data?
* Does a user have multiple EHR records or just one?
    * User has multiple EHRs.
* Is there nod ID of EHR record in the audit record?
