Specs:
* Five patients, two audit companies who attempt to access the audit data.
* Guarding EHR data not required.
* Audit data is given in clear as input to the system.
* Should be scalable and distributed but for PoC simplicity it can run on single machine and socket programming is not needed, message exchange can be implemented by writing and reading to and from a file.
* Confidentiality & integrity protection required of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
* The system should enforce immutability, if an attacker tampers with some audit data the system should report the attack. Just detection of tempering is enough.
* Implement routines to support identification and authorization
* Implement routines to support "Decentralization" goal

Queries:
* Patients can query the system to monitor usage of their EHR data.
    * Add get_query_history route?
* Audit companies can query the system to monitor usage of EHR data for a set of patients.

Audit record:
* Date and time of logged event
* Patient ID whose record was accessed
* User ID who performed the logged event
* Action type (create, delete, change, query, print, copy)

Architecture ideas:
* EHR Rest API sends record to Audit Rest API, Audit Rest API encrypts data using patients public key and the audit companies public key and stores in the audit log.
* When patient requests query data he needs to authenticate somehow (sign a timestamp? maybe sign instead a nonce sent by the Audit Rest API? Or server encrypts a random number with patient's public key and the patient needs to decrypt it and send it back?) Data is sent to the patient encrypted and symmetric key is sent encrypted as well using patient's key, just like it's stored.

Questions:
* Should audit companies only be allowed to query data?
* Does a user have multiple EHR records or just one?
    * User has multiple EHRs.
* Is there nod ID of EHR record in the audit record?
